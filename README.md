If you look four main lines down from the top of the page, or just above the green box with two arrows, 
you will see "# commits". Click on that, and you will be taken to a page where you can review the steps I have taken. 

This is my development of a website tracking Bitcoin usage/culture. It is powered by Wordpress 3.7.1, and 
I am hosting it with Bluehost. Thus far I have modified the CSS for several portions of the menu, and 
customized the Bitcoin trading ticker (logo, text color).
